The space complexity is also  due to the set used to store the values encountered during the traversal, which can store up to  unique values in the worst case.\n",

    "The solution is clear and effective, using DFS and a set to detect duplicates in the tree. The main criticism is that the recursive DFS approach could be improved by using an iterative approach to avoid potential stack overflow in case of a very deep tree. Other than that, the implementation is efficient and solves the problem correctly.\n",

By reviewing my partner's solution, I was able to see how DFS can be applied to tree problems and how to track values using a set. The process also helped me understand how to analyze time and space complexity effectively."
